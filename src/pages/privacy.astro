        <h2>2. Data Collection on our Website (Hosting)</h2>
        <p>
          Our website is hosted by <strong
            >[Name of Host, e.g., Vercel/Netlify]</strong
          >. The provider automatically collects and stores information in
          so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits
          to us (browser type, OS, referrer URL, IP address, time of request).
          This data is not combined with other data sources. The basis for data
          processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR (legitimate interest in technical
          stability).
        </p>

        <h2>3. Data Collection and Services in the Apps</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Infrastructure & Development (Expo)</h3>
        <p>
          We develop and operate our apps using the <strong>Expo</strong> framework
          (650 Industries, Inc., USA). Expo allows us to deliver updates ("Over-the-Air
          Updates") and ensure technical functionality. Technical connection data
          may be processed in this context.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Analytics & Improvement (PostHog)</h3>
        <p>
          To identify errors and improve the app, we use <strong>PostHog</strong
          > (PostHog Inc., USA/UK).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Data processed:</strong> IP address (stored in anonymized form),
            device information, usage data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Location & Security:</strong> We use the PostHog EU Cloud (Server
            location: Frankfurt, Germany). To the extent data is transferred to the
            USA, this is based on the EU Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses
            (SCC).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal Basis:</strong> Legitimate interest (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3 Purchases & Subscriptions (RevenueCat)</h3>
        <p>
          We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> (RevenueCat, Inc., USA) to manage in-app
          purchases and subscriptions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Function:</strong> RevenueCat validates purchase receipts from
            the App Stores (Apple/Google) to determine your subscription status.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data processed:</strong> App User ID (pseudonymized), purchase
            history, subscription expiration dates. We do not have access to your
            credit card details or your real name; these are stored securely by Apple
            or Google.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Device Permissions</h2>
        <p>
          The app may request certain permissions (e.g., camera, notifications).
          You can revoke these permissions at any time in your operating system
          settings. Access is only used for the specific functionality within
          the app.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
          You have the right to request information about your stored personal
          data, its origin, recipients, and the purpose of data processing at
          any time without charge. You also have the right to request the
